### Software is provided as is. Author is not responsible for any losses you might experience while working with this
program.

Please read the following original README file for instructions how to use and make sense of the original program.

**Setup Instructions for the Backend (Including H2)**

### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure JDK 11 or higher is installed. I used Amazon Corretto 23.0.2.
2. **Maven:** Install Apache Maven for dependency management and build.
3. **Docker:** Install Docker and ensure it is capable of running.
    I used Docker for imaging and programming platform virtualization.
4. (optional) **IntelliJ Idea:** Install Idea Community if not present. I used latest IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition.

### Running the program and verification of the results
1. Unzip zipped project folder file strategiclear.zip, that you received, into IdeaProjects/strategiclear folder.
2. cd into the unzipped project folder.
     cd IdeaProjects/strategiclear
3. In the folder **Rebuild the Project if needed:**
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. **Run the Docker Application:**
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   The backend will be available right immediately after the server starts. Meaning scheduler starts immediately
   searching for active tasks to create. Also scheduler configuration is setup to run a scheduler every 5 minutes.

**Instructions for Running Tests**
  Tests are always running on each build. But here are instructions for running them explicitly.
1. **Ensure the Environment is Set Up:**
   - No active H2 connection is required for tests as the application uses an in-memory H2 database during testing.

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```
   mvn test
   ```

3. **Verify Results:**
   - The test summary will be displayed in the terminal. Ensure all tests pass.

**Software Documentation: Explanation of the TreatmentTaskSchedulerService**

#### **Description**
This is a simple service, which manipulates Task entries in the database according to the specific Plan entries.
Service does not create any Tasks if there is no Plans present in the database.
Service does not create any Tasks for past due Plans.
Service creates and schedules a Task if it is active in the closest hour for that one run.
SchedulerConfig makes sure Service runs at fixed rate every 5 minutes.
Service can handle multiple plans at once if they are currently active.
It can handle multiple recurrence patterns at once as well, in example "08:00, 10:00" without issues.

If you're interested to check the Service more, you are welcome to edit and extend TreatmentTaskSchedulerServiceTest,
which allows you to test the functionality yourself and see it in action.

#### **Notes**
- Service uses Liquibase as a DB initializer, including initial DB preparation, creation of the tables,
columns, foreign keys and indexes.
- The service uses embedded in-memory H2 service, which is available only for servicing one program at a time as a
service. It uses simple locking algorithm to make sure of the data integrity and consistency. If you need to check the
database state, please use H2 in server mode, which allows multiple connections at a time to one DB.
- Sometimes due to upper-stated tests fail. Cause is exactly the embedded in-memory DB allows only one program to work
with a DB at a time. Just make sure you use this DB setup appropriately, close other DB connections and rerun the tests.
- Other cases might be: other various unforeseen exceptions... Just report them to the author at ostapkr@gmail.com.
    I'll be happy to help you!

*** Case explanation
   Expected Output: Correct tasks creation and scheduling based on the programming task description.
   This functionality is considered important and is implemented in this project.
